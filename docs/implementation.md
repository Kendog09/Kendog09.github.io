# Implementation

## Introduction
The implemented system is a mobile web-based application designed to facilitate the tracking of public toilet facilities. The dataset utilized by the system includes detailed information about the public toilets including their locations, accessibility features, and availability times. The dataset retreived from bristol open data is loaded streight into the web apps data table in a format that the user can read and understand it easily. One issues with the dataset is there may be occasional inaccuracies or incomplete information about the toilet locations or features. Overall, the system aims to be as accurate, reliable, and user freindly as possible using a detailed dataset and usefull features to have a seamless user experience.

PottyPal is the main file which includes all of the html, css, and javascript required for the web app to run. Below this file is the docs file which is where all the documentation is included. Within the docs file is an images file which is a bank of all images used including diagrams and screenshots. The documentation is then split into planning, requirements, design, implementation, testing and deployment which all include different stages of documentation of development.
