# Deployment

## Release Notes

PottyPal version 1.0 currently includes a main menu with options that allow you to access information about public toilets. So far these options only cover use case 1 and use case 2 with use case 3 not yet being fully implemented. For the map, mapbox was used along with Bristol open data for all the information on the toilets. The code consists of mainly HTML but also some CSS and JavaScript and this was made on visual studio code as it was the most efficient development tool.

The diagram below shows the interaction between Github and Bristol Open Data:
