# Project Proposal

## Business Case

### Problem statement
In urban environments such as Bristol, having accessable public toilets cis a persisten challenge for visitors and residents alike. This is a problem that remains persistent despite being a fundamental necessity. The problem is not necessarily the lack of public toilets but instead the lack of information on where they are. To avoid further discomfort, health hazards and inconvenience, there needs to be a more easy and simple way for the general public to locate the correct services that can also accommodate their specific needs such as baby changing rooms or disability facilities.

### Business benefits
There are many business benefits that can lead to a successful outcome, some of these include:
-Improved convenience, users can quickly locate public toilets which can save time and reduce stress associated with searching for restroom facilities.

-Enhanced Accessibility, having access to toilets with the correct facilities means individuals with disibilites or specific needs can easily identify accessible toilets with features such as handrails or wheelchair ramps which promotes inclusivity and independence.

-Positive public relations, supporting public health and wellbeing by providing essential services to people controbites to positive public relations which will also strengthens the brands image allowing it to be spread further due to good reviews and positive feedback.

### Options Considered
There are not a huge range of options currently avaliable that cover this issue but one of the most popular ones is google maps which allows you to search to see where any public toilets in the area are, however it does not provide detailed information about facilities or which gender the toilets are suitible for. Google maps is also much more complicated and may be confusing for certain people such as the elderly.

### Expected Risks
There are a few risks that present problems that could occur and should be taken into consideration, some of these are:

-Frequent updates, if the apps information is not frequently updated or the data is not avaliable for it too be updated then a toilet that is under maintinance or that has had changes to the avalibility of services may be incorrectly recommended leading too users wasting time travelling too the wrong one.

-Bugs or issues, if there are any technical issues with the app that lead to users having problems with the desgin may lead to them being put off using the app or leaving bad reviews which will effect its reputation. 

-Competitors, it could be difficult for people to start using the app due to the fact big companies like google maps are already peoples first pick option when searching for directions.

## Project Scope
Code needed:

-Data from Bristol open data must be uploaded to allow the map locations to be shown.

-Map must be loaded onto the website and should be interactive incluing moviving it around and clicking.

-Data that includes information such as facilities and opening times must be avaliable after searching.

Other features needed:

-The app must include a search-bar so users to search for locations near them.

-The user must be able to add certain filters so only appropriate toilets will be shown.

-It must request permission to find the users location and compare it to the nearest toielet to them.

-The mobile device will require some sort of connection including wifi or mobile data.
