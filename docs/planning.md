# Project Proposal

## Business Case

### Problem statement
This project will be used by the public to help people locate public toilets in and around Bristol.

The problem we would like to highlight is that there isn't enough public toilets in the area.

### Business benefits
Find toilets nearby for people walking around Bristol, and any tourists visiting the area.

### Options Considered
TODO: What are some other customer options or leading products that address the same needs?

### Expected Risks
Recommending a toilet that is under maintenance, or closed for an unknown reason.

The toilets are likely to get more traffic, therefore require more cleaning and monitoring.

## Project Scope
TODO: Scope of the System of Interest. Include a bullet list of things from your context diagram that are in scope.
