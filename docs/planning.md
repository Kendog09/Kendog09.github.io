# Project Proposal

## Business Case

### Problem statement
In urban environments such as Bristol, having accessable public toilets cis a persisten challenge for visitors and residents alike. This is a problem that remains persistent despite being a fundamental necessity. The problem is not necessarily the lack of public toilets but instead the lack of information on where they are. To avoid further discomfort, health hazards and inconvenience, there needs to be a more easy and simple way for the general public to locate the correct services that can also accommodate their specific needs such as baby changing rooms or disability facilities.

### Business benefits
Find toilets nearby for people walking around Bristol, and any tourists visiting the area.

### Options Considered
TODO: What are some other customer options or leading products that address the same needs?

### Expected Risks
Recommending a toilet that is under maintenance, or closed for an unknown reason.

The toilets are likely to get more traffic, therefore require more cleaning and monitoring.
